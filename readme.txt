What I was able to do: 

1)Created a custom plugin in WordPress, that displays a form allowing a user to search the Google News web service for rss feeds.
2)Created an admin version of the plugin to demonstrate the functionality in the settings UI. 
3)Created a settings UI in the admin version to demonstrate the functionality in the back end. 
4)Created a public version of the plugin so the AJAX would return and display for public facing pages and posts containing the plugin. 
5)Used AJAX to send a url string with the search query to Google News web service. 
6)Used AJAX to update the page with the results from the web service without a page refresh. 
7)Included a loading notification to the user during the time the request was made and the time the data loaded. 

What I was unable to figure out how to do in the time allotted: 

1)Format the returned RSS feed.
